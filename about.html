    <p>
        Originally from Dallas, I am currently a senior here at the University of Oklahoma's Price College of Business, studying both Finance and Management Information Systems while being enrolled in the Honors program.
        In the three and a half years I've been at the University, I've joined several orgranizations that have allowed me to advance my skills personally and professionally.
        These organizations include my fraternity, Beta Upsilon Chi, as well as the JCPenney Leadership Program, which takes the top 5% of all Price students.
