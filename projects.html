<h4>Database</h4>
<h5>
    In Spring of 2023, I enrolled in a course focused on the construction and management of a database. Throughout the semester, our team constructed the database, as well as populated the database using custom inputs designed for an autoshop.
    The database was then able to read in SQL queries to allow for user designated outputs based on the information stored.
