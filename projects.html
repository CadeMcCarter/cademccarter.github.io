    <h4>Database</h4>
    <h5>
        In Spring of 2023, I enrolled in a course focused on the construction and management of a database. Throughout the semester, our team constructed the database, as well as populated the database using custom inputs designed for an autoshop.
        The database was then able to read in SQL queries to allow for user designated outputs based on the information stored.

    <h4>GitHub</h4>
    <h5>
        All of the coding assigments from the past three years have accumulated on my GitHub page, showing the past three years of progress and assignments I've learned and mastered.'

        This assignment has allowed me to create a fully functioning HTML page from scratch, complementing with a CSS document to create a universal style for the page.
