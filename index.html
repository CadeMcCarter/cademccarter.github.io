        <h1>Cade McCarter's Personal Website</h1>

        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal website. Although the purpose of this website was simply for an assignment,
            it functions as a way for me to showcase my works developed during my time here at the University of Oklahoma.
        </p>

        <p>Once again, welcome to my site, and please feel free to use the navigation bar at the top of the page to learn more about my experiences and works.</p>
